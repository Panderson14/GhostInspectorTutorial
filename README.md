# GhostInspectorTutorial

This tutorial is a document that I created while interning at the Center for Open Science as a Quality Assurance intern. I had created the foundational tests for automated testing in Ghost Inspector, and was a big part of the movement from manual testing over to automated UI testing. After learning the ins and outs of the tool, I wrote this document and helped the other full-timers get started with Ghost Inspector so that they could continue automated testing after I left.
